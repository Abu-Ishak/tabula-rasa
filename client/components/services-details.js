            Combining innovation and art world experience, Tabula Rasa bridges
            the gap between e-commerce and the traditional gallery model, making
            art accessible to all. We are always looking to source the highest
            quality affordable artwork for projects of any size and budgetâ€”if
            you are a gallerist or dealer who believes that your artist roster
            could be a good curatorial fit for our project, please reach out.
